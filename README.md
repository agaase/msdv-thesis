## Wasted Time : Travel in Delhi

### Abstract
Traffic congestion in Delhi is a perennial problem and major concern area for urban planners. Although a problem, there have been few micro-level studies to analyse the impact it has. Studying the impact is a first step towards identifying problems and prioritizing them. The first direct impact due to congestion is the excess time taken while travelling from one place to another. Multiple other effects lead from this and analysing it correctly could lead to understanding of those. This project aims to study the same by collecting, analysing and visualizing data related to travel time from areas across the city.

The visualization is at both; macro level, understanding patterns across the city and at micro level, for a particular area. Visualization offers the ability to make relationships and understand the reason behind the excess time for a particular area or region. It also provides for the ability to combine and play with multiple variables to analyse how different factors and their relationship could play a role in congestion. 


### Introduction
In one of the studies conducted by Urban Designer based in Bhopal India, it was found that there has been 250% increase in travel time while travelling a distance of 40 km by a private vehicle in Delhi during peak hours. If we just consider it from the point of view of time, it is a considerable impact to the daily life of a Delhi resident taking away a major share of his 24 hours in travel. The purpose of this thesis is to explore in detail the "wasted" time that has been effecting the people of Delhi taking into account variables which could explain its criticality and the reasons for it. “Wasted” is used here to signify the excess time people spend while travelling from one place to another due to traffic or congestion. The project visualizes the same; both, at a macro level understanding patterns across the city and micro level for a particular area.

This topic is more of a personal interest to me. I have been myself frustrated by the traffic congestion in Delhi and wanted to analyse what is happening. At some point acknowledging the facts and making people aware about it is important. With this project I want to do the same and also at the same time develop a research tool to assess and analyse the situation.

There are different variables on which this project can further be studied upon like the day of the week, time of the day, different types of areas through which one can filter and get a filtered perspective.  As such there are many important questions that I aim to address such as - 
- Which areas take more time to travel in the city and hence more critical?
- For different distances what is the excess time ?
- Is there an extreme variation in travel time based on time of the day or day of the week?
- How does the situation looks like for different areas like schools, hospitals, commercial areas?
- What does the situation look like for a particular area?

But, what is the value of this type of analysis? There are several important real life problems that can be addressed by this visualization.
- Criticality - We are identifying areas which face excess time and also how much of it which gives an indication as to how critical is that area to receive attention.
- Field of movement - urban traffic is more than just the share of people coming in and out during their office hours. Analysis of areas which take more time to travel could give an indicaton to the type of travel happening.
- Bottleneck  - When we do analysis at a micro level, trying to understand if there's an extreme variation at different distances we could identify bottlenecks.
