## How is Delhi slowing down?

### Abstract
Traffic congestion in Delhi is a perennial problem and major concern area for urban planners. Although a problem, there have been few micro-level studies to analyse the impact it has. Studying the impact is a first step towards identifying problems and prioritizing them. The first direct impact due to congestion is the excess time taken while travelling from one place to another. Multiple other effects lead from this and analysing it correctly could lead to understanding of those. This project aims to study the same by collecting, analysing and visualizing data related to travel time from areas across the city. The visualization is at both; macro level, understanding patterns across the city and at micro level, for a particular area. Visualization offers the ability to make relationships and understand the reason behind the excess time for a particular area or region. It also provides for the ability to combine and play with multiple variables to analyse how different factors and their relationship could play a role in congestion.

### Introduction
In a publicly released data set by California Highway Patrol there were 5,090 collisions in LA County that year involving bikes and cars in 2012. This figure is enough to make it an above average city when it comes to bicycle deaths in the city. Bicycle deaths is a cause of great concern. But, how do you analyse those accidents and understand the reasons as to what could be going wrong. The city of Los Angeles collaborated with Data Science; a company specialising in Data Visualization to develop a visualization to identify those collisions geographically and also understand the major causes of it. They also released the project to public asking people to identify areas and figure out what could be going wrong. The project led to multiple insights both in terms of identifying which road or street was the number one affected area and what could be the most obvious causes of it. Identification of the problem at ground level proved to be the key to reduce the occurrences in future. With this project, the effort is to implement a visualization which can identify congestion in Delhi and generate generate insights as well as patterns to offer practical solutions. The thesis describes the approach and details behind that visualization and also the final analysis that was resulted with the same.
Delhi is the capital city of India. Its population of 25 million has almost doubled over the last two centuries making it the second most populated city in world. It is also a highly urbanised center with a mix land use pattern giving rise to congestion and long travel time for the commuters. In one of the studies conducted by Urban Designer based in Bhopal India, it was found that there has been 250% increase in travel time from 2011 to 2016 while travelling a distance of 40 km by a private vehicle in Delhi during peak hours. What is causing this congestion? Is it population growth, personal vehicle consumption, lack of public transport, inefficient road planning and management ? The answer always is a combination of these reasons and varies across different factors. This motivates the need for identification through visualization, the problem and the factors associated with it so one can find and explain relationships. This will involve a primary variable which can signify congestion and other variables related to it which help in making correlations and the criticality. The correlation can be contextual or analytical. The visualization tries to support both type of correlations by having a map based approach for the former case and a more quantitative visualization based approach for the latter. Also, with these correlation the effort is try to provide insights to real world problems like -
- Criticality - We are identifying areas which face excess time and also how much of it which gives an indication as to how critical is that area to receive attention.
- Field of movement - urban traffic is more than just the share of people coming in and out during their office hours. Analysis of areas which take more time to travel could give an indicaton to the type of travel happening.
- Bottleneck  - When we do analysis at a micro level, trying to understand if there's an extreme variation at different distances we could identify bottlenecks.

The coming sections explain in details the approach towards buildings this kind of visualization and how the correlations can be possible.
